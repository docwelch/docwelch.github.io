The weather station itself is controlled by an Arduino. All data is sent back, via XBee to a BeagleBone Black. The BeagleBone pushes the data to Weather Underground. This project was created as a step in building a smart irrigation controller. Currently, this project is still a work in progress, though it does seem to be functioning.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
