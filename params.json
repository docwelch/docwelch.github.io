{"name":"Docwelch.github.io","tagline":"","body":"#Welcome to My GitHub Pages.\r\nHere you will find my coding projects. I am not a professional coder - just someone who likes to tinker.\r\n\r\n##Current Projects\r\n\r\n### [Weather Station](https://github.com/docwelch/Weather-Station)\r\nThis project uses parts from [Sparkfun](www.sparkfun.com). The weather station itself is controlled by an Arduino. All data is sent back, via XBee to a BeagleBone Black. The BeagleBone pushes the data to Weather Underground. This project was created as a step in building a smart irrigation controller. Currently, this project is still a work in progress, though it does seem to be functioning.\r\n\r\n### [Two Temps](https://github.com/docwelch/TwoTemps)\r\nA friend needed a device to measure both the return and supply air temperatures on central air/heat. I put this together for him and it has worked quite well. With the WiFly creating its own access point, you can be at the outside unit and monitor what is going on at the inside unit from your smartphone.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
